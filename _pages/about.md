# Bio
I earned my graduate degree in Geography Education from Universitas Muhammadiyah Prof. Dr. Hamka. I am currently preparing to pursue a Master’s program in Earth Physics at Institut Teknologi Bandung through the Degree by Research (DBR) scholarship by BRIN, under the supervision of [**Prof. Dr. Erma Yulihastin**](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=sSOYsccAAAAJ&hl=en&oi=sra). My research interests focus on large-scale and mesoscale atmospheric dynamics, with particular emphasis on (i) the El Niño–Southern Oscillation, (ii) tropical convection, and (iii) mesoscale convective systems. I have contributed to the scientific community through the publication of several manuscripts in both national and international high-impact journals. 

# Educations
- *2021-2025*, B.Ed. in Geography, Universitas Muhammadiyah Prof. Dr. Hamka.

# Projects 
- **Influence of Climate Variability on Extreme Significant Wave Heights** (Putri et al., 2024)  
  In this project, I quantified the significant wave height values at the 99th percentile and correlated them 
  with interannual climate variability (ENSO) over the waters of Sumatra and West Kalimantan.

- **Agroclimatic Suitability of Sorghum Plantation over West Java, Indonesia** (Wulandari et al., 2025)  
  In this project, I processed climate data over 10 years (2010–2019), as well as projection data for 2030 and 
  2050 under different radiative scenarios. The output includes the climate suitability index for sorghum in 
  West Java, aligned with the intraseasonal–seasonal–annual patterns for the periods 2010–2019, 2030, and 2050.
